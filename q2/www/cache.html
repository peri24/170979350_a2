    <p>A short definition of Browser Cache: "A temporary storage area in memory or on disk that holds the most recently downloaded Web pages. As you jump from Web page to Web page, caching those pages in memory lets you quickly go back to a page without having to download it from the Web again. In order to ensure that the latest page is displayed, the browser compares the dates of the cached page with the current Web page." Beacuse of MailChimp's functionality as follows:
      "We use cookies to limit the number of times each site visitor sees your pop-up form. After the first time a visitor sees the form, it won't display to them again for another year unless they clear their cookies or open your site in another browser" the cache must be cleared every time upon revisit so that the user may be pressented with the pop up. </p>
